Welcome to react-microservices's documentation!
===============================================

react-microservices is a system component definition and API endpoints exposure tool.
react-microservices lets you define your system via react components and expose as
API endpoints. Unlink other normally seen web framework, react-microservices is easy
to register a new system component and simple to use. react-microservices is aiming to:

* Glue your APIs. Your API endpoints can be a standalone calls that depend on no
other remote services, or a complex webflow that tangles with several remote
API endpoints and combines them into one API endpoints.
* Draw a blueprint of your entire system. You can easily inspect system call graph
and optimize them.
